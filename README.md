# ArtEcho 🎨

**Where Local Art Finds a Global Echo.**

ArtEcho is a modern web application designed to bridge the gap between local artisans and a global audience. It empowers craftspeople by providing them with powerful AI tools to tell their stories, market their products, and connect with brands that align with their style.

## About The Project

In a world of mass production, the unique stories behind handmade crafts are often lost. ArtEcho was created to solve this problem by giving artisans a platform to shine. By leveraging generative AI, the platform helps artisans create compelling marketing materials, generate audio stories for their products, and find the right buyers—all without needing any technical expertise.

This creates a richer, more meaningful connection between the creator and the consumer, turning every purchase into a story.

## Key Features

- **AI Story Card Generator**: Artisans can input details about themselves and their products, and the AI will generate a beautiful, engaging story card. It also creates an audio version of the story, making it accessible to everyone.

- **AI Brand Matchmaker**: Brands can describe their style and desired market trends (e.g., "minimalist, sustainable"), and the AI will analyze the available artisans and products to recommend the perfect partners.

- **Virtual Exhibition**: Buyers can explore a curated gallery of unique products. Clicking on an item opens a "Story Card Modal," which uses AI to generate a fresh narrative and audio story on the spot.

- **Artisan & Product Profiles**: Clean, detailed pages for each product and artisan, highlighting their craft, location, and personal journey.

## How ArtEcho Empowers Local Artisans

ArtEcho is more than just a marketplace; it's a digital partner for artisans.

- **Effortless Marketing**: It automates the creation of high-quality marketing content, saving artisans time and effort.
- **Authentic Storytelling**: It helps translate the artisan's personal story and cultural heritage into a format that resonates with modern consumers.
